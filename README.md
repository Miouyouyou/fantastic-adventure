Currently this project depends on https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/gltf for importing GLTF on the fly.

I'd like to note that Runtime import is FUCKING SLOW at the moment... ~1 minute for importing a model.
The same model takes a few seconds at most, to be imported inside the editor. Something's dead wrong.
